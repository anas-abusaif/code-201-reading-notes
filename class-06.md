# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Problem domain.
the problem domain is the range that includes every element that is connected to the problem, for example, when developing a system to measure good practice in medicine, carpet drawings at hospitals would not be included in the problem domain.

## Objects
JavaScript object is a standalone entity that holds multiple values in terms of properties and methods. Object property stores a literal value and method represents function. An object can be created using object literal or object constructor syntax.

Example:
```
let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}
```

## The DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page. A Web page is a document.
