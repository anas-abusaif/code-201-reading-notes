# Introductory HTML and JavaScript


 
 <font size="4">HTML</font> 

  HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

  **general layout:**

```<html>
<head>
<title>This is the Title of the Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is the Body of the Page</h1>
<p>Anything within the body of a web page is
displayed in the main browser window.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
<font size="4">JavaScript</font>

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.


Example:

```<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>


```
